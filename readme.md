* Constructors in Python are special methods within a class that are used to initialize objects when they are created from that class. Constructors are defined with the **__init__** method name. The **__init__** method is automatically called when you create an object from the class, and it allows you to set up the initial state (attributes) of the object.
*  The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the attributes (data members) of an object.
* The self parameter is a reference to the object being created. It is a convention in Python to name this parameter as self. You can think of it as the instance of the class, and it allows you to access and manipulate the object's attributes within the constructor.
* You don't need to explicitly call the __init__ method when creating an object from the class. It is called automatically when you create an instance of the class.
